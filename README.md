## About

This is a path for those of you who want to complete the Data Science undergraduate curriculum on your own time, **for free**, with courses from the **best universities** in the World.

In our curriculum, we give preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) style courses because these courses were created with our style of learning in mind.

## Curricular Guideline

OSSU Data Science uses the report [Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Data Science](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/EDU-DataScienceGuidelines.pdf) as our guide for course recommendation.

### Order of the classes

Some courses can be taken in parallel, while others must be taken sequentially. All of the courses within a topic should be taken in the order listed in the curriculum. The graph below demonstrates how topics should be ordered.

### Track your progress

[Fork](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-fork-a-github-repository/) the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ossu/data-science) into your own GitHub account and put ✅ next to the stuff you've completed as you complete it. This can serve as your [kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) and will be faster to implement than any other solution (giving you time to spend on the courses).

### Which programming languages should I use?

Python and R are heavily used in Data Science community and our courses teach you both. Remember, the important thing for each course is to internalize the core concepts and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

### Final project

Part of learning is doing.
The assignments and exams for each course are to prepare you to use your knowledge to solve real-world problems.

After you've completed the curriculum,
you should identify a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
You can create something entirely new, or you can improve some tool/program that you use and wish were better.

Students who would like more guidance in creating a project may choose to use a series of project oriented courses.
A sample of options
(many more are available, at this point you should be capable of identifying a series that is interesting and relevant to you)
are available on [this page](extras/specializations.md).

### Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above,
you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Data Science.
Congratulations!

What is next for you? The possibilities are boundless and overlapping:

- Look for a job as a data scientist!
- Check out the [readings](extras/books.md) for classic books you can read that will sharpen your skills and expand your knowledge.
- Join a local data science meetup (e.g. via [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)).
- Pay attention to emerging technologies in the world of data science.
